Postman Testing Instructions

To run controller tests using Postman:

✅ Step-by-Step Guide

Import Test Collections
Import the corresponding JSON files for each controller 
(e.g. AuthController Tests, LeaveController Tests, etc.) 
into Postman.

Run Tests Individually

⚠️ Important: Execute each request one at a time.
Running them as a full collection may cause failures 
due to pre-request dependencies (like authentication tokens).
